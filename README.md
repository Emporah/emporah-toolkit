# Emporah 💰
A personal, evolving project born out of frustration with using multiple, time-inefficient tools (such as spreadsheets) to manage finances.

🚀 Conquer Your Finances!
Emporah is an emporium of financial tools designed to empower individuals and small businesses who lack the time or resources to hire a financial advisor or accountant. Most individuals and small business owners find finance and accounting laborious—I'm hoping to change that!

Emporah aims to simplify financial calculations, planning, and decision-making while making finance more accessible and engaging.

The goal is to start with a few basic tools and gradually develop them with increasing complexity to maximize their usefulness. See the features below to check what's currently in progress.

🔹 Features
